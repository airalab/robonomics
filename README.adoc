> Implementation of a https://robonomics.network node in Rust, based on the https://substrate.dev[Substrate framework].

This repo contains runtimes for the Earth Parachain, Mars Parachain, and Robonomics Relay chain networks. The README provides information about installing the robonomics binary and developing on the codebase. For more specific guides, like how to be a node, see the https://wiki.robonomics.network[Robonomics Wiki].

Robonomics platform includes a set of open-source packages and infrastructure for Robotics, Smart Cities and Industry 4.0 developers.

== Try it out

. https://get.robonomics.network[Get Node] and/or https://parachain.robonomics.network[Open Portal].
. Run the https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/playground-overview/[Robonomics Playground].

== The Robonomics Crates

Structure of **Robonomics** followed:

- **Robonomics Node** - substrate-based blockchain node with Robonomics Network extensions.
- **Robonomics CLI** - console line primitives that make framework functions runnable.
- **Robonomics Protocol** - network library that helps to build P2P communication in Industry 4.0 and Smart City cases.
- **Robonomics Frame** - a collection of pallets suitable for Smart City and Industry 4.0 cases.

Full docs available at https://crates.robonomics.network.

== Building from source

Ensure you have Rust and the support software installed:

[source, shell]
----
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
----

You will also need to install the following packages:

 . Linux:
[source, shell]
sudo apt install cmake git clang libclang-dev protobuf-compiler

 . Mac:
[source, shell]
brew install cmake pkg-config git llvm

 . Windows (PowerShell):
+
[source, shell]
----
# Install LLVM
# Download and install the Pre Build Windows binaries
# of LLVM  from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html
----

Install robonomics node from git source.

[source, shell]
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/airalab/robonomics --tag v3.0.0 robonomics

And then launch full node of robonomics testnet parachain.

[source, shell]
robonomics

Or run your local development network.

[source, shell]
robonomics --dev

=== Building with Nix

 . Install Nix package manager:
[source, shell]
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

 . Run in Nix shell:
+
[source, shell]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/airalab/robonomics && cd robonomics
nix-shell --run "cargo run --release"
----

=== Running Benchmarks

Build the node with benchmarking features enabled.

[source, shell]
----
cargo build --release --features runtime-benchmarks
----

Then run the benchmark script to generate weights.

[source, shell]
----
./scripts/weights/benchmark-commands.sh
----

== Network maintaining

Currently Robonomics is maintained by developers but anyone can https://www.robonomics.events/#/collators[support the project].
Every additional full node of blockchain helps it to be more sustainable and fault tolerant.
Robonomics node binaries is available in https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases[release] assets
or it could be <<building-from-source,build from source>>.

=== Gatekeepers updates

* Release: image:https://img.shields.io/github/release/airalab/robonomics.svg["Release", link="https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases"]
* Telemetry: https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/RobonomicsEarth

Launch command:
[source, shell]
----
robonomics --collator --lighthouse-account [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]
----

== Robotics integration

Of course, Robonomics should integrate open-source robotics, our main target is http://www.ros.org[ROS]-enabled robots.
The node implements a few features to make robotics integration as easy as it possible.
