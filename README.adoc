Robonomics platform includes a set of open-source packages and infrastructure for Robotics, Smart Cities and Industry 4.0 developers.

== Try it out

. https://get.robonomics.network[Get Node] and/or https://parachain.robonomics.network[Open Portal].
. Runs the https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/playground-overview/[Robonomics Playground].

== The Robonomics Crates 

Structure of **Robonomics Framework** followed:

- **Robonomics Node** - substrate-based blockchain node with Robonomics Network extensions.
- **Robonomics CLI** - console line primitives that make framework functions runnable.
- **Robonomics IO** - stream-oriented library with support general set of sensors and actuators (including virtual devices like PubSub or stdin/stdout) that makes hardware interaction easy.
- **Robonomics Protocol** - network library that helps to build P2P communication in Industry 4.0 and Smart City cases.
- **Robonomics Frame** - a collection of pallets suitable for Smart City and Industry 4.0 cases.

Full docs available at https://crates.robonomics.network.

== Building from source

Ensure you have Rust and the support software installed:

[source, shell]
----
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# on Windows download and run rustup-init.exe
# from https://rustup.rs instead
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
----

You will also need to install the following packages:

 . Linux:
[source, shell]
sudo apt install cmake git clang libclang-dev

 . Mac:
[source, shell]
brew install cmake pkg-config git llvm

 . Windows (PowerShell):
+
[source, shell]
----
# Install LLVM
# Download and install the Pre Build Windows binaries
# of LLVM  from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html
----

Install robonomics node from git source.

[source, shell]
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/airalab/robonomics --tag v0.25.1 robonomics 

And then launch full node of robonomics testnet parachain.

[source, shell]
robonomics

Or run your local development network.

[source, shell]
robonomics --dev

=== Building with Nix

 . Install Nix package manager:
[source, shell]
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

 . Run in Nix shell:
+
[source, shell]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/airalab/robonomics && cd robonomics
nix-shell --run "cargo run --release"
----

== Network maintaining

Currently Robonomics is maintained by developers but anyone can https://www.robonomics.events/#/collators[support the project].
Every additional full node of blockchain helps it to be more sustainable and fault tolerant.
Robonomics node binaries is available in https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases[release] assets
or it could be <<building-from-source,build from source>>.

== Robotics integration

Of course, Robonomics should integrate open-source robotics, our main target is http://www.ros.org[ROS]-enabled robots.
The node implements a few features to make robotics integration as easy as it possible.

=== Gatekeepers updates

Actual release : https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v0.25.0[0.25.0 Rococo V1.2 "Gatekeepers on Earth"]

Telemetry: https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Earth[Earth parachain]

Launch command: 
[source, shell]
----
robonomics --parachain-id 1000 --name <Your_name>
----


== Robonomics I/O

Especially to make hardware interaction easy we introduce https://crates.robonomics.network/robonomics_io/index.html[robonomics_io] crate. This crate implements two kinds of devices: `source` - device that intended to read a data and `sink` - device that intended to write data. This approach suits the pipelines paradigm well and implemented in Robonomics CLI as `io` subcommand.

```
$ robonomics io
robonomics-io 0.25.1
Run I/O actions using Robonomics Framework.

USAGE:
    robonomics io [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    read     Read information from device
    write    Write information into device
```

For example, the sentence that simple read value from Nova SDS011 sensor is followed.

```bash
$ robonomics io read sds011
{"timestamp":"1588090281","pm25":0.5,"pm10":1.5}
```

Is it also possible to combine IO actions to get something useful.
Following sentence reads JSON values from a sensor and publishes it into `my-sensor-data` topic.

```bash
$ robonomics io read sds011 | robonomics io write pubsub my-sensor-data
```

Read https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/rio-overview/[full guide on wiki]. 

=== Building with ROS feature

 . Install ROS using http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation[instruction].

 . Import ROS environment:
[source, shell]
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

 . Build with `ros` feature:
[source, shell]
cd bin/node && cargo build --release --features ros

=== Examples

Available examples are in https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/tree/master/examples[this directory].

==== Curiosity Rover under Robonomics control

Simple but yet a complete sample of Robonomics `launch` and `datalog` functions.
You can find full documentation on https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/connect-mars-curiosity-rover-under-robonomics-parachain-control/[Robonomics Wiki].
