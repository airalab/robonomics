> Implementation of a https://robonomics.network node in Rust, based on the https://polkadot.com/platform/sdk/[Polkadot SDK]. For more specific guides, like how to be a node, see the https://wiki.robonomics.network[Robonomics Wiki].

Robonomics platform includes a set of open-source packages and infrastructure for Robotics, Smart Cities and Industry 4.0 developers.

== Try it out

. https://get.robonomics.network[Get Node]
. https://parachain.robonomics.network[Open Portal]

== The Robonomics Crates

Structure of **Robonomics** followed:

- **The Node** - Robonomics Network OMNI node with buildin Polkadot & Kusama parachain specs.
- **Frame / Pallets** - a collection of pallets suitable for Smart City and Industry 4.0 cases.

Full docs available at https://crates.robonomics.network.

== Building from source

Ensure you have Rust and the support software installed:

[source, shell]
----
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
----

You will also need to install the following packages:

 . Linux:
[source, shell]
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

 . Mac:
[source, shell]
brew install pkg-config git llvm

 . Windows (PowerShell):
+
[source, shell]
----
# Install LLVM
# Download and install the Pre Build Windows binaries
# of LLVM  from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html
----

Install robonomics node from git source.

[source, shell]
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/airalab/robonomics --tag v4.0.0 robonomics

And then launch full node of robonomics testnet parachain.

[source, shell]
robonomics

Or run your local development network.

[source, shell]
robonomics --dev

=== Building with Nix

 . Install Nix package manager:
[source, shell]
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

 . Run in Nix shell:
+
[source, shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/airalab/robonomics && cd robonomics
nix-shell --run "cargo run --profile production"
----

=== Running Benchmarks

 . Install the frame-omni-bencher command-line tool:
+
[source, shell]
----
cargo install frame-omni-bencher
----

 . Build the node with benchmarking features enabled:
+
[source, shell]
----
cargo build --release --features runtime-benchmarks
----

 . Run the benchmark script to generate weights:
+
[source, shell]
----
./scripts/weights/benchmark-commands.sh
----

== Network maintaining

Currently Robonomics is maintained by developers but anyone can https://www.robonomics.events/#/collators[support the project].
Every additional full node of blockchain helps it to be more sustainable and fault tolerant.
Robonomics node binaries is available in https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases[release] assets
or it could be <<building-from-source,build from source>>.

=== Gatekeepers updates

* Release: image:https://img.shields.io/github/release/airalab/robonomics.svg["Release", link="https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases"]
* Telemetry: https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/RobonomicsEarth

Launch command:
[source, shell]
----
robonomics --collator
----

== Robotics integration

Of course, Robonomics should integrate open-source robotics, our main target is http://www.ros.org[ROS]-enabled robots.
The node implements a few features to make robotics integration as easy as it possible.
