Blocks will be produced at a minimum duration defined by `SLOT_DURATION`, but some slots will not be allocated to any authority and hence no block will be produced. We expect to have this block time on average following the defined slot duration and the value of `c` configured for BABE. This value is only used indirectly to define the unit constants below that are expressed in blocks. The rest of the code should use `SLOT_DURATION` instead (like the timestamp module for calculating the minimum period). https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/BABE/Babe/#6-practical-results"],["MINUTES",""],["PRIMARY_PROBABILITY",""],["SECS_PER_BLOCK",""],["SLOT_DURATION",""]]};
